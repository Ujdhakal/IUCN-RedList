# IucnRedList

Welcome to our exciting web application project, IUCNRedList, where we showcase a demonstration of various frontend frameworks and quality frameworks. Drawing inspiration from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), we have utilized the [IUCN Red List API](https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/) to access valuable resources.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.8.4.

## Technology Stack
1. Angular 16
2. Angular Material
3. SCSS
4. Karma 
5. Jasmine
6. TypeScript 

## Features and Quality 
1. Integrated API from [IUCN Red List API](https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/)
2. Dark theme
3. Unit test cases using Karma and Jasmine

## Development Server

Run `npm i` inside the downloaded/cloned folder to install npm dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Improvements

Although a flexbox design approach has been implemented, it can be further improved by adopting a mobile-first development approach.
Additional features of IUCN can be integrated for a more comprehensive user experience.
